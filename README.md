### Instructions to run the wrapper
1. clone this repository into a new directory
```
git clone https://github.com/jcara/compbio-PythonWrapper.git
```
2. run the wrapper
```
python3 pythonwrapper.py
```
3. the output can be found in the pythonwrapper.log file


### Required software
1. BioPython
2. Prokka
3. Bowtie2
4. Tophat2
5. Samtools
6. Cufflinks


### Notes
When running my final run, Prokka went down on the server, so I was unable to run through the entire code for last minute debugging and confirming results are correct. This also prevented me from generating a completed log file, I was debugging using stdout prior to Prokka going down
